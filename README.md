## 4. What I have learned and what could have been done better

That project was a great opportunity to practice HTTP requests via Fetch API. I studied how to make them before but I had a lot of problems with the headers until I was able to receive success in them. In my opinion would had been so much easier if the documentation of the API had some examples.

One thing that I really wanted to do was implement this project with the MVC architecture, but that would been difficult in the short period of time given, and the lack of good references on how to implement MVC in vanilla javascript. In the future I want to make that and work on a new design, since in this one I followed the one that was given, and use getters and setters in de App class.
